In this workshop we will discuss and practice how to manage asynchronous flow in Node applications.
We’ll consider a couple of ways, starting with Event Loop queues, Task Queue pattern, and finishing
with working threads to ensure that you choose the best approach for your task.

**Second part:**

Module Fédération - Beyond The Theory

Let’s take a closer look at Microfrontends behind the scenes of theory. Will do some practice with
Module federation and see why it’s a proper solution for large teams. On top of that, we will discuss
how NX can help us.
