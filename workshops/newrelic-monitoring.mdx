Synthetics monitoring is simulating user traffic and behavior on your application. It is essential to proactively detect and
resolve outages and poor performance issues before any users notice. In this workshop, you will build your own synthetics monitoring
test suite using Selenium webdriver and popular JavaScript testing frameworks. You will learn how to anticipate user behavior,
both in all the expected ways and in all the unexpected ways, and build automated solutions to test for it.
