We've come a long way from pen and paper. In this workshop, you'll learn how to build apps with statecharts - a method of drawing diagrams
that can be executed as production code. This opens up new opportunities for collaboration - helping you improve the handoffs between product,
design, and dev.

We'll be using XState - an open-source statechart tool for JavaScript - and Stately's visual tools to build an internet banking app,
from diagram to deploy. You'll learn how to model any piece of code using states, events, actions and services.
