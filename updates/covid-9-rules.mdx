We know that there is a lot of uncertainty about COVID-19 at the moment. We try our best to keep you informed about the laws and rules in effect.

For that, [we created a dedicated subpage where we list all the COVID-19 information](/covid) you and your family members travelling with you would need.
There's separate information for travel and for attending the conference, please make sure you read both!
