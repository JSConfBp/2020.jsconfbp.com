A few weeks ago, we asked members of the community and ticket holders how confident they felt
about attending JSConf Budapest in September 2021, and most respondents indicated they would
not be able to do so.

**Our number one priority is to put on a conference that everyone can safely attendâ€”at a
location where people feel safe to travel.**

Due to the results of that survey and the fact that the current situation and
vaccination progress in Europe and worldwide has not improved significantly in the past
few weeks, unfortunately, we have no other choice but to postpone the conference.

**The new date is set to June 2-3, 2022.**

## What happens to my ticket?

Every ticket purchased for JSConf Budapest 2020 and 2021 still remain valid. If the new date
does not work for you, or for any other reason you would rather have your money back,
no problem at all. Reach out to us so we can help you resolve the issue.

## What happens to my CFP submission?

Unlike last yearâ€”when we rejected every submissionâ€”this year, we continue the evaluation
process as usual. From what we have seen so far, we trust that the topics you sent us
will be just as relevant a little over a year from now than they would be now.

We will put the lineup together shortly and reach out to all the selected speakers hoping
that they feel the same way and that the new date works for them. We are working from
home during the pandemic, which means we find it harder to allocate time to thoroughly
read all talk submissions. We ask for a little more patience. ðŸ’–

Keep everyone safe out there, and let's meet & celebrate in June 2022!
