  Ever since Google announced the webpage performance, as measured by Core Web Vitals (CWV) is a ranking factor starting May 2021, it has become the de-facto standard for measuring performance on the web. But while they seem straightforward, it turns out the CWV are anything but. In this talk we will dive into the technical details of CWV, and understand what they actually measure, and how they themselves are measured. What you learn in this talk will definitely surprise you!
